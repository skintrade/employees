# Demo Employee Crawler

This is a demo of an employee data crawler - for testing and demonstration purposes only

### development information

This was built in php and developed on a Wampserver instance (Apache 2.4.46, PHP 7.3.21, MySQL 5.7.31). There is minimal JS implemented, purely for elements of interaction that require it.

Note: The CSS implementation is over engineered for this purpose, and is scaled from a custom sass build I created for rapid deployment and development of UI, without relying on twitter bootstrap etc.

## important

This uses the DB from https://dev.mysql.com/doc/employee/en/ so please follow the relevant setup information for this.

## Deployment for testing

The whole repository can be deployed to a domain, sub domain, VirtualHost.
